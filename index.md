##### Nova for making the server (i guess...)
## Step 1:
First you open google chrome (of course)
## Step 2:
[Click here](https://github.com/NovasGreat/salogenx/raw/main/index.html) and what should appear is some text. When you are on that page, double click and click "Save As" and it should download to your files (blue file button on chromebooks)
## Step 3:
Open the file, seriously. Open your files app, and double click the file you just downloaded (the file you just downloaded is called "index.html" and open it.)
## Step 4:
A new google chrome tab should open up, and it should say "Eagtek" and a little picture beside it, now, the fun part, let it load. It will tell you to click a button to continue, so do that. If an error spits out, reload the page.
## Step 5:
When it is done loading, set your skin and username. (youve probably already have done this before in your life)
## Step 6:
Now the hard part, putting the server. First, in the middle of the screen, click the button that says "Multiplayer" and a screen should appear.
## Step 7:
Next, click the button where theres a bunch of buttons below called "Add Server" and another screen should appear.
## Step 8:
On the server name, put whatever you want, just something that you would remember.
## Step 9:
On the server address, put this: wss://salogenx-v2.novasgreat.repl.co/
## Step 10:
Click done.
## Step 11:
Click on the server and on the bottom click "Join Server".
# You're done!
