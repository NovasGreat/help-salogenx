<h2 id="step-1-">Step 1:</h2>
<p>First you open google chrome (of course)</p>
<h2 id="step-2-">Step 2:</h2>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NovasGreat/1.5/main/index.html">Click here</a> and what should appear is some text. When you are on that page, double click (click with two fingers) and click &quot;Save As&quot; and it should download to your files (blue file button on chromebooks)</p>
<h2 id="step-3-">Step 3:</h2>
<p>Open the file, seriously. Open your files app, and double click the file you just downloaded (the file you just downloaded is called &quot;index.html&quot; and open it.)</p>
<h2 id="step-4-">Step 4:</h2>
<p>A new google chrome tab should open up, and it should say &quot;Eagtek&quot; and a little picture beside it, now, the fun part, let it load. It will tell you to click a button to continue, so do that. If an error spits out, reload the page.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-">Step 5:</h2>
<p>When it is done loading, set your skin and username. (youve probably already have done this before in your life)</p>
<h2 id="step-6-">Step 6:</h2>
<p>Now the hard part, putting the server. First, in the middle of the screen, click the button that says &quot;Multiplayer&quot; and a screen should appear.</p>
<h2 id="step-7-">Step 7:</h2>
<p>Next, click the button where theres a bunch of buttons below called &quot;Add Server&quot; and another screen should appear.</p>
<h2 id="step-8-">Step 8:</h2>
<p>On the server name, put whatever you want, just something that you would remember.</p>
<h2 id="step-9-">Step 9:</h2>
<p>On the server address, put this: wss://salogenx-v5.novasgood.repl.co/server/</p>
<h2 id="step-10-">Step 10:</h2>
<p>Click done.</p>
<h2 id="step-11-">Step 11:</h2>
<p>Click on the server and on the bottom click &quot;Join Server&quot;.</p>
<h1 id="you-re-done-">You&#39;re done!</h1>
